This is my project code. In the 'Images' folder you will find the three classes of images;
  - not rust: containing all the images without any rust present
  - black rust: containing all the images with black rust present
  - brown rust: containing all the images with brown rust present

Inside the 'models' folder you can find the previously trained mode. When the code is run a newly trained model will be created inside this folder and the older model is deleted.

The 'Model.ipynb' is the Juypter Notebook containing all of the code for this project.

If you have any problems running the code, since Github doesn't allow me to upload the virtual environment to the repository, feel free to contact me on russell.cachia.g53991@mcast.edu.mt
